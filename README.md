Project Statement
You must write a program in the Python programming language that can build a Non-Deterministic Finite Automaton (NFA) from a regular expression,  
and can use the NFA to check if the regular expression matches any given string of text. You must write the program from scratch and cannot use 
the re package from the Python standard library nor any other external library.

Aim
The aim of this project is write a program in Python that can check if a given string matches a regular expression built through a Non-Deterministic Automation (NFA). The re package, which provides regular expression matching operations, may not be used.
